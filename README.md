# Figures-and-Solids
This project is implemented in C++ 14. It uses shared_ptr for memory management, exceptions,iterators and containers from Standard Library.
It allows user to make some operations on figures and solids like calculating figure surface area or volume of a solid. 
Figures and solids data can be written and read from file - data means for example values of square sides or calculated surface areas. 
User can make calculations in real time and write them to file, when he wants to exit program.
Data is written into file with XML tags.
